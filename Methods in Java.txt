A Method is a block of code which runs only when it is called

A method is similar to fucntion written inside a class. 
Since java is a OOP langauage, therefore we need to write the method inside the same class.


public class employee{
	static void myMethod(){
	System.out.println("HELLO I am insode method");
	}
	
public static void main(String[] arga){
		
		myMethod();
		
		}
}


----------------------------
Calling a Method 

A method can be called by creating an object of a class in which the method exisits foloowed by a method call

	Calc obj = new Calc(); ----> Object Creation
	obj.mySum(a,b); ----> Method call upon object
	
	
---------------------------

Void Return Type :- When we don't want our method to return anything, we use void as the return type


Static Keyword:- Static keyword is used to associate a method of a given class with the class rather than the object.
				 Static method in a class is stored by all the objects
				 
The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.


------------------------------
Method Overloading 
-------------------------------
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:
Method overloading cannot be perfomed by changing the return type of methods


eg:-  int myMethod(int x)
	  float myMethod(float x)
	  double myMethod(double x, double y) 
	  
	  void foo()
	  void foo(int a)
	  void foo(int a, int b)
	  
	  
	
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}
