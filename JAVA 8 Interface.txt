Before java 8 when we used interface we cannot define the body of the interface i.e. onlt method was there.

But now in java 8 feature we can actually define the method inside the interface using the default keyword, we can aslo override the deault methods 

interface Hello{
	
	void add();
	default void show(){
		
		}
		
		}
		
Java dosen't support Multiple iheritance as it creates the diamond probelm, but in interface we can get multiple inheritance


Java 8 support static methods 

interface I {
	
	static void show(){
		syso("HELLO");
		} 
		}
		
		static methods is used for common functionality
		
		default is used for instance to instance
